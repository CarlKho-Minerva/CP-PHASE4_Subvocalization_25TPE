# Section 1: Data Explanation

## Dataset Overview

This project uses **single-channel surface EMG (sEMG) signals** captured from submental muscles during silent speech tasks. The data represents an extension of the Phase 3 single-lead forearm EMG dataset to silent speech recognition—an attempt to replicate MIT Media Lab's **AlterEgo** system (Kapur et al., 2018) for **$30** instead of **$1,200+**.

> **Note on Hardware Adaptation:** This project was originally designed as a dual-channel system (chin + jaw). Due to hardware limitations discovered during testing—one AD8232 exhibited ADC saturation near the 12-bit ceiling—the system was adapted to single-channel operation. Full troubleshooting documentation is available in the [working_process/](../working_process/) directory.

### The "Accidental Hardware Match"

The **AD8232** is designed for ECG (heart monitoring), but its hardware bandpass filter is accidentally perfect for speech EMG:

| System | Target Frequency | AD8232 Filter |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| MIT AlterEgo | 1.3Hz – 50Hz | ✓ |
| AD8232 Native | 0.5Hz – 40Hz | Hardware match! |

**No software filtering was needed—the hardware does it mechanically.**

## Hardware Adaptation: Dual-Channel to Single-Channel

### Original Design Intent

The initial design followed AlterEgo's multi-site electrode approach:
- **Channel 1 (Digastric/Mylohyoid):** Under-chin placement for tongue position tracking
- **Channel 2 (Masseter):** Jaw/cheek placement for bite intensity measurement

### Hardware Limitation Discovered

During validation testing (December 19, 2025), the two AD8232 units exhibited significantly different baseline ADC characteristics:

| Sensor | Baseline ADC | Heart LED | Operational Status |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| AD8232 #1 (Red PCB) | ~1,800 | Flickering ✓ | Functional |
| AD8232 #2 (Purple PCB) | ~3,800 | Not flickering | Saturation risk |

The second sensor's baseline near the 12-bit ADC ceiling (4095) meant that any muscle activation would saturate the signal, resulting in clipped waveforms and loss of amplitude information. Serial monitor output during testing:

```
ADC: 3796 | LO+: 1 | LO-: 1 | Status: ✓ Board responding
ADC: 3823 | LO+: 1 | LO-: 1 | Status: ✓ Board responding
ADC: 3921 | LO+: 1 | LO-: 1 | Status: ⚠️ ADC RAILING HIGH
```

> *Caption: Video documentation of the troubleshooting session identifying the saturation issue.*

### Design Decision: Single-Channel Focus

Given the hardware constraint, a pragmatic decision was made to proceed with single-channel data collection using the functional AD8232 unit. This decision was informed by analysis of feature discrimination capabilities:

| Feature Type | Dual-Channel | Single-Channel | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Spatial (chin vs jaw ratio) | ✓ Available | ✗ Lost | Cannot compare channel ratios |
| Temporal (firing sequence) | ✓ Available | ✓ Preserved | Primary discriminator |
| Frequency (ZCR, spectral) | ✓ Available | ✓ Preserved | Secondary discriminator |
| Amplitude (signal strength) | ✓ Available | ⚠ Reduced | Lower confidence without reference |

**Mitigation Strategy:** With single-channel operation, the classification model must rely primarily on **temporal features** (onset timing, duration, activation sequence) and **frequency features** (zero-crossing rate, spectral characteristics) rather than spatial discrimination between electrode sites.

## Critical Hardware Fixes

### 1. The SDN Pin Fix (Discovered in Phase 3)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL:** The AD8232's Shutdown (SDN) pin floats on generic clones, causing massive signal instability.

**Solution:** Wire SDN to 3.3V (HIGH) directly on the ESP32.

```
ESP32    →    AD8232
3.3V     →    3.3V
GND      →    GND
3.3V     →    SDN (CRITICAL FIX!)
GPIO34   →    OUTPUT
```

> *Caption: Close-up of the SDN pin jumping to 3.3V to prevent signal floating.*

### 2. Cable Shielding (Noise Reduction)

The stock 3-lead cable (~1 meter) acts as an antenna for 60Hz noise.

**The Fix:**
1. **Cut cable to <20cm** (face-to-board distance)
2. **Twisted Pair:** Twist Signal+ and Signal- wires together (maximizes CMRR)
3. Or use **shielded microphone cable**

## Electrode Placement

### Anatomical Targets

The electrode placement targets the **Digastric/Mylohyoid muscle group**, which controls tongue elevation and depression during speech articulation.

The ground electrode is placed on the **Mastoid Process**—the bony protrusion behind the ear—which provides an electrically neutral reference point away from active musculature.

## Hardware Validation Protocol

To ensure signal integrity before data collection, a 3-step "Parking Lot Test" was performed:

**Step 1: Heartbeat Sanity Check**
- Electrodes on chest.
- **Success Criteria:** Clean, rhythmic QRS complex (heartbeat) every ~1s.
- **Purpose:** Verifies sensor and ADC functionality.

> **[INSERT IMAGE]** `images/img_serial_plotter_heartbeat.png`
> *Caption: Clean ECG signal confirming sensor health.*

**Step 2: Jaw Clench Noise Check**
- Electrodes on Jaw. Bite down hard.
- **Success Criteria:** Signal "explodes" into high-amplitude chaos (>2000 units).
- **Purpose:** Verifies electrodes are making contact and amplifier isn't saturated.

> **[INSERT IMAGE]** `images/img_serial_plotter_jaw_clench.png`
> *Caption: High-amplitude EMG burst during forceful jaw clench.*

**Step 3: Subvocalization "Wiggle"**
- Electrodes on Chin. Say "GHOST" internally.
- **Success Criteria:** Small but distinct disturbance from baseline noise.
- **Purpose:** Confirms detection of fine motor units in the tongue.

## Vocabulary Selection: "Tongue Gymnastics"

Words were chosen based on **distinct neuromuscular signatures**, not semantic meaning.

### The Insight

> *"You are building a Biological Keyboard, not a Telepathy Helmet."*

Since electrodes are under the chin, we're tracking **tongue position**, not sound. Choose words that force the tongue to do radically different things.

### Tier 1: High Success Rate

| Word | Tongue Physics | Expected Signal |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **GHOST** | Back of tongue → soft palate ("G" slam) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High-frequency burst |
| **LEFT** | Tongue tip → alveolar ridge ("L" touch) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Distinct onset |
| **STOP** | Plosive "ST" + "P" = jaw engagement | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Combined signal |
| **REST** | Tongue flat, relaxed | Control (silence) |

### Tier 2: Control Word

**"MAMA"** — Lips only (Orbicularis Oris). Tongue stays flat.
- **Purpose:** If you subvocalize "MAMA" and see a chin signal spike, you're picking up **noise**, not muscle.

## The Motor Intensity Spectrum

### 5-Level "Descending Motor Intensity" Framework

To validate the low-cost hardware, we employ a **Transfer Learning** strategy across the motor intensity spectrum.

> **The Insight:** Training on "Open Mouth" movements (Mouthing) provides strong, high-amplitude signals that help the model learn the temporal dynamics of each word. We then transfer this knowledge to "Closed Mouth" (Silent Articulation) scenarios.

| Level | Terminology | Description | Signal | Role |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|------|
| 1 | **Overt Speech** | Natural speaking voice | 🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊 | Calibration |
| 2 | **Whisper** | Low-volume vocalization | 🔊🔊🔊🔊 | Calibration |
| 3 | **Mouthing** | **Open-Mouth** silent speech with maximal jaw excursion | 🔊🔊🔊 | **Training Data** (Source) |
| 4 | **Silent Articulation** | **Closed-Mouth** speech with exaggerated internal tongue movement | 🔊🔊 | **Testing Data** (Target) |
| 5 | **Imagined Speech** | Minimal/Micro-movements (Reading to self) | 🔊 | Exploratory |

### Data Collection Summary

Data was collected across all five motor intensity levels on December 19, 2025. Full session documentation: [2025-12-19_speech_spectrum_capture_session.md](../working_process/2025-12-19_speech_spectrum_capture_session.md)

| Level | Cycles Completed | Vocabulary | Output File |
|-------|------------------|------------|-------------|
| L1 Overt | 10 | GHOST, LEFT, STOP, REST | `overt_data.csv` |
| L2 Whisper | 10 | GHOST, LEFT, STOP, REST | `whisper_data.csv` |
| L3 Mouthing | 50 | GHOST, LEFT, STOP, REST | `mouthing_data.csv` |
| L4 Subvocal | 51 | GHOST, LEFT, STOP, REST | `subvocal_data.csv` |
| L5 Imagined | 10 | GHOST, LEFT, STOP, REST | `imagined_data.csv` |

### Transfer Learning Rationale
**Open (Level 3) → Closed (Level 4)**

We assume that the *temporal sequence* of muscle activation (e.g., G-H-O-S-T) remains consistent between open and closed mouth states, even if the *amplitude* changes.
- **Training (Level 3):** Learn the neuromuscular "signature" of the word with high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
- **Inference (Level 4):** Detect the same signature in the constrained, closed-mouth environment.

## Known Confounds and Limitations

The following artifacts were observed during data collection and documented for transparency:

| Confound | Description | Potential Impact |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Saliva Swallowing** | Periodic swallowing creates spurious EMG bursts unrelated to speech | May contaminate REST class labels |
| **Post-Mouthing Muscle Tension** | After extensive L3 trials, chin muscles remain partially activated | REST labels after mouthing may not represent true baseline |
| **Syllabic Beat Artifact** | Involuntary micro-movements synchronized to word rhythm, even during L5 | "Imagined speech" may contain detectable motor artifacts |
| **Recording Timing Convention** | Words vocalized at countdown "2" to center signal in analysis window | Consistent across all levels; enables time-alignment |
