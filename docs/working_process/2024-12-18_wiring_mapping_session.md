# Working Process Log: AD8232 Wiring Mapping

**Date:** December 18, 2024
**Session Time:** 10:49 AM – 11:04 AM (15 minutes)
**Activity:** Hardware verification – 3.5mm jack to electrode snap wiring mapping

---

## Summary

Tested and confirmed the wiring mapping for the 3.5mm audio jack to colored electrode snaps used with the AD8232 ECG sensor. Verified consistency across two separate AD8232 units.

## Verbatim Transcript

> "I'll be testing out the mapping. Now Green and... Green touching the tip. Nothing. Middle finger... middle... rather... there we go, Green is in the middle of the jack. Red is at the end, and Yellow is the tip.
>
> So from tip to the back, it's Yellow, Green, and Red.
>
> Confirming with my other jack... just to make sure it's all consistent, 'cause I have two AD8232s. One I have re-soldered. So, testing it again. Hopefully, the Yellow is the tip.
>
> So Yellow... Yellow is the tip for the second one—which is my original one—Red is the back, and Green is the middle.
>
> Cool. It seems I'm ready for my AD8232 subvocalization project. Perfect."

## Processed Data: Wiring Mapping

| 3.5mm Plug Segment | Color Snap |
| :----------------- | :--------- |
| **Tip**            | Yellow     |
| **Ring (Middle)**  | Green      |
| **Sleeve (Back)**  | Red        |

## Project Notes

- **Device:** AD8232 Heart Rate/ECG Monitor
- **Verification:** Wiring tested on **two separate cables/units** and confirmed consistent
- **Status:** One unit re-soldered; both confirmed functional
- **Intended Use:** Subvocalization (Silent Articulation) project

## Next Steps

- [ ] Begin electrode placement testing
- [ ] Capture initial EMG/ECG signals
- [ ] Validate signal quality for subvocalization detection
